# OsuBackgroundReplacer
Replaces osu background without supporter


**Usage**   
To use skin bg put "#UseSkinBg" in your config file

If you want to use a custom bg either put "##UseSkinBg" or don't put anything at all in the config file
If you want to use a custom bg you also need to put your desired background image (png or jpg) in "\Osu\Data\bg\" and name it either "bg.jpg" or "bg.png"


Note: Seasonal backgrounds needs to be activated for this to work

Another note: I think the background gets dynamically added so you might have to cycle through them once for this to work
