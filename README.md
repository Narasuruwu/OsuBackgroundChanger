# OsuBackgroundReplacer
Replaces osu background without supporter


**Usage**   

Put the executable in your osu root folder

To use your selected skins background *~~if it got one~~* put "#UseSkinBg" in your config file    
note: "#UseSkinBg" needs to be anywhere above "Skin = "

If you want to use a custom background either put "##UseSkinBg" or don't put anything at all in the config file
If you want to use a custom background you also need to put your desired background image (png or jpg) in "\Osu\Data\bg\" and name it either "bg.jpg" or "bg.png"


Note: Seasonal backgrounds needs to be activated for this to work

Another note: I think the background gets dynamically added so you might have to cycle through them once for this to work


**Update**

So I happened so stumle across this similar thing after I made this application: [HoLLy-HaCKeR's background changer](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-BackgroundChanger)
